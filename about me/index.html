    <h2>Jared Arp</h2>
    <p>I am a data science major planning on working for a real estate company. I like to watch movies (especially horror) and play chess. I am taking this course because I would like to be able to create a better website for the small company that I work for. I've been a member of the Church of Jesus Christ of Latter-day Saints for 18 years and am loving it!.</p>
    <p>I also like video games such as Super Smash Bros. Ultimate and the Mario Party games. Some of my favorite movies are the Lord of the Rings and Star Wars movies.</p>
